## Abstract

Physical built environment conditions affect occupantsâ€™ health, attitudes, motivations, and general well-being. The state of classrooms is no exception. Classroom conditions have direct effects on teachers and students and ultimately on academic outcomes. In addition to the physical condition of classrooms, the atmosphere of the environment, which is established mostly by the choices and attitudes of educators, has a profound influence on students. Classrooms differ vastly in both physical conditions and social atmospheres. The remedy for the physical differences has been discussed and debated for years, and can be summarized predominantly through equalizing funding. The purpose of this paper is to offer another angle of investigation on identifying and closing the environmental gap by focusing on the whole environment, not just the brick and mortar portion. The angle being proposed is that of using Self-determination theory (SDT)1 to equalize the environmental experiences of students. SDT is a macro theory of human motivation, development, and wellness.2 SDT studies social conditions, such as those created in classrooms, by examining how environments are either supporting or thwarting basic psychological needs. SDT defines the basic psychological needs as autonomy, competence, and relatedness. I propose
that using the lens of SDT to study and categorize the most detrimental classroom environmental disparities will spark ideas to establish an effective plan to remediate those disparities.
