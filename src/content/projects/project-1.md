**Abstract**
The purpose of this qualitative research was to identify the preparation needs of principals through the lens of school superintendents in the southeastern United States. This research was based on a collaborative university, multi-school district partnership. Superintendents were interviewed to determine their perceptions regarding the professional learning needs of principals. Three themes emerged from the analysis:(a) principal perception of community matters, (b) formal support is necessary, but challenging to schedule and scope, and (c) instructional and operational leadership are differentiated. These findings present several implications for university and district-based leadership preparation programs, both individually and collaboratively.
